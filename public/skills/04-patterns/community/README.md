## How to Contribute

1. Create a new markdown file with your pattern
2. Use the naming convention: `{github-handle}-{pattern-name}.md`
3. Follow the template in `99-evolution/templates/pattern-template.md`
4. Submit a Pull Request

## File Naming

```
{github-handle}-{pattern-name}.md

Examples:
- zhangsan-loading-button.md
- lisi-drag-drop-list.md
- wangwu-theme-switcher.md
```

## Quality Guidelines

Your pattern should:
- ✅ Solve a real problem
- ✅ Be reusable (not project-specific)
- ✅ Include working code examples
- ✅ Explain when to use it

## Promotion to _base/

High-quality, well-tested community patterns may be promoted to `_base/` by maintainers. This means:
- The pattern becomes part of the official skill set
- Credit is preserved via the `author` field
- The pattern gets a numbered prefix for ordering
